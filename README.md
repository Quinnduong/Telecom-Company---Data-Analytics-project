# Telecom-Company---Data-Analytics-project
Here, we have analyzed the dataset of an European Telecom Company.

This Telecom's Attrition Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer cancelled the subscription.

We explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer attrition and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

Business Understanding Of A Telecom Industry Customer Attrition:

Customer attrition is a big problem in any industry and one of the most important concerns for the Telecom industry.

The effect on the revenues of the companies, because of this customer attrition is huge, especially in the telecom field, that's why these companies are seeking to develop a predictive potential customer attrition.

In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual attrition rate, and it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, that's why customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

Therefore, finding those factors that increase customer attrition is important to take necessary actions to reduce this attrition.

The main goal of our project is to develop an understanding of the cause of customer attrition which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to attrition, and what to do to retain the most valuable customer.
We will find how we can maximize the profit by retaining customer, and, how we can reduce the attrition rate by identifying the issues.
